# Space Game

This project was developed with React. I developed the game because want to improve my algorithm skills in React.

## How to play ?
*When the game start there are your SpaceCraft and Meteors. Meteors are going to hit you in Hyperspace you should dodge them with Arrow Keys of keyboard.*

**Actually I want to save whole users score in a database but when I was developing the project, I didnt know how to make it. If you'd like to contribute my project and improve game (like save data in database) you can make a Pull Request.

I used:

- React
- Firebase to host
